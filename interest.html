          <h1>My Interests</h1>
          <p>
            My Intersts include <br />
            Minecraft, I play it on the regular I usually play modded Minecraft
            like Origins (check the bottom of the page) <br />
            <br />
            Music, I like to listen to music :D <br />
            <br />
            Drawing, I like to draw little things like flowers :D they're pretty
            <br />
            <br />
            Astromony, I like the stars and planets and moons. I like to learn
            about them so my favourite topic in school was Science :) <br />
            <br />
            Fishing, I like to go fishing just not every time <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Minecraft: Origins; On a Minecraft server my friends and I are on we
            do some lore on the server <br />
            we have an idea of what we want to be done for it and this is how it
            goes so enjoy reading :) <br />
            <br />
            LORE: I am a crazy scientist the experimented on the other players
            and they all turned out to be origins. <br />
            With that all of us have had our memory wiped and throughout the
            season we will slowly but surely find the 'lab'. <br />
            Some of us are in one area and are a "family" but none of us know
            who we are until later :). <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            and here are the links to the people most likely to be streaming the
            lore as i know of :)
